A fullstack application that can create a loan payment schedule with the given amount, interest rate, time period. Intermediate payments are also allowed. Payment schedules can be retrieved from a sqlite database by id. Angular is used for frontend, .NET framework is used for the backend. client directory is the angular application that recieves loan data (interest, period) and makes HTTP requests to the API for the payment schedules. API directory contains the RESTful API that contains the business logic. It calculates the monthly installments, principal and interest payments and returns the client a payment schedule object. I completed this project during my internship at VAKIFBANK.
